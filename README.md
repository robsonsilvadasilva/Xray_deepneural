## Project on Convolutional Neural Networks to detect pneumonia on X-ray Images.

This repository contain all files that I used in my final project on Ironhack bootcamp.

I was able to construct a Convolutional Neural Network with Pytorch to detect pneumonia from X-ray images.

As well, I tested LightGBM and XGboost to measure their perfomance. On the presentation pdf you can see the benchmarking between frameworks. 

In the Flask folder you will find a simple deployment of the project with Flask.

If you have any doubts or questions please send me a e-mail or you can find me on LinkedIn.
