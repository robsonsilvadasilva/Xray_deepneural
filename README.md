This repository containll all files that I used in my final project on Iron Hack School.

The goal was to construct a Convolutional Neural Network with Pytorch to detect pneumonia from X-ray images.

As well, I tested LightGBM and XGboost to measure their perfomance.

In the Flask folder you will find a simple deployment of the project with Flask.

If you have any doubts or questions please send me a e-mail or you can find me on LinkedIN.
